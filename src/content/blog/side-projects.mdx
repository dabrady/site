# Side projects
I’m tired of hiring managers, CTOs, and founders asking me about “my side projects” and being dismissive or disappointed when I don’t send them a GitHub link.

I’m sorry-not-sorry, but I’ve passed the point in my career where I felt the need to work more than I was paid for.

I do other things with the time I don’t sell. I’m sure you don’t manage random people just for fun, or found a new tech startup every weekend. So what’s the problem here?
