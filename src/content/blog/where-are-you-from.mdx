# “Where are you from?”
I stumble whenever I am asked this question. What answer should I give? What are they looking for? Do they want to know where I was born, or where I was raised, or where I’ve lived the longest, or where I was before I was here, or…?

I used to be confident in my answer. But that was before anyone ever really asked me. Where I was raised, you’re never asked that question unless something about you (your skin, your voice, your face) indicates you Ain’t From Around Here.™️ And so I always knew, growing up, that I was from Here; there was no question, and no questioning.

But now, that place is firmly in my past, and though it is certainly where I came from, I’m not certain it should still be my answer.

Something I’ve noticed these last few years is that in Europe, when people ask
>”Where are you from?”

The answers given by Europeans tend to be their country of origin. In much the same way, I now realize, that within the United States of America, if someone asks you that, we tend to respond with our ‘home state’. When I was in my home state, I was from my city; when I moved to another state, I was from my home state.
<aside>
Unless our city is well-known like San Francisco or New York or Boston, in which case we often lead with that.
</aside>

I started becoming unsure of my answer when I moved to another state _again_. Was I still from my home state? Is it even my home state anymore? Shouldn’t my home state by where my home is? But I live here now, this is where my home is, and when I talk about visiting my family I use the phrase “going back home”…. And why do I think ‘home’ has anything to do with it? They didn’t ask me, “Where’s home for you?” My answer started becoming longer.

Interestingly, once I left the United States, my answer started becoming shorter again, but it’s never quite the same answer as the last one I gave.

It seems to vary with my mindset, these days. If I’m feeling nostalgic or melancholic, I’m from where I was born. If I’m feeling excited and full of life, I’m from wherever I just came from.

But I have this sense that I’ll never be from Here again, and that makes me kind of sad.
