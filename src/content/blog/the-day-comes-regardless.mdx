# The day comes regardless
Sometimes when I wake in the morning my mind is quiet. I open my eyes and all I can see is the world outside, with nothing in my head getting in the way. But only for a few momentsâ€”  when I notice the quiet my self comes crashing back like the Koolaid man.

Otherdays, like this one, my self arrives first but stays in the car for a bit, trying to hold on to the bliss of driving alone in the dark. I keep my eyes closed, mutely rejecting the day, and remember the night.
