Hello again — it’s been awhile. I started publishing here when I became unemployed, and stopped when I found a job. That was nearly two years ago now — kind of crazy how short it feels. Anyways. I’m back in Lisboa for the summer, employed and bored — existentially, I mean; so I’m resurrecting this platform as an outlet for the accompanying woes.

I think I’ll try publishing some of my older writings soon — thoughts on places and life and such. I also want to start writing more ‘op ed’ pieces, to get more comfortable with the opinions I have. I often read books and listen to lectures and then share my reactions to them with friends, so those will be another source of material I publish here. And my friends occasionally make the joke, “Where in the world is Brady?” because of how frequently I move around these days— perhaps I could start writing about my travels, too.

I want to develop a writing style more suited to this long format. I spend the vast majority of my waking life writing, actually, in three broad categories: short-form business communications, long-form software programs, and long-form diary entries. When I write for this blog, though, I’m uncertain of the strategies and design aesthetics to employ, and I end up with inconsistent amalgamations of the sort of writing I’m most comfortable producing. Obviously the only way to ‘develop a writing style’ is to write until one develops naturally — so that’s what I’ll do.
