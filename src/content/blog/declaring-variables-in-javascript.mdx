title: Declaring Variables in JavaScript
series: Miniseries
---

The variable declarators available to us in JavaScript, and more specifically when to use them, are a hot topic of conversation these days. A few weeks ago, I read an article called ["Another var vs let vs const"](https://dev.to/stearm/another-var-vs-let-vs-const-27g1).

Though the title made me smile, my response to the advice given was less positive:

>I think we can summarise everythings in a few lines:
>
>* `var`: why? if you can avoid it, do it;
>* prefer `const` usage if possible of course (together with an immutable approach when updating objects)! But don't be scared using `let`, especially if the scope of your variables is small, for example inside a function.

To be clear, I think it is very nice summary of the reigning opinion I've been exposed to; but the gospel-like way in which it is given triggered a knee-jerk reaction of mine, which is to immediately question bold statements made without supporting arguments.

I realized I don't entirely agree, but **I couldn't articulate why**. So it got me thinking many hours of thoughts. And with deep thought comes opinions:

- Immutable approach to state management? ‚úÖ
- Prefer `const`? üôÖ
- Avoid `var`? üôÖ
- Embrace `let`? ‚úÖ

If you choose to follow my dive into this particular rabbit hole, I'd appreciate feedback!

## the tools: a miniseries
{/* / */}
I've written a miniseries of posts that encourages deep thoughts about variable declaration in JavaScript.
{/* / */}

Each post dives deeper into one of JavaScript's variable declarators, and rather than constitute a sequence they are intended to be standalone, interrelated references.

<Aside>

üìñ Most of the differences between our variable declaration tools pertain to (lexical) scope, so if you don't have a firm grasp of that subject, I highly recommend Kyle Simpson's short book _[Scope and Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)_; it's a fantastic resource, and I think Kyle does a great job at explaining this area of language design in an easy-to-follow way.

</Aside>

I have chosen to give them identical structures and also tried to keep the examples* as similar as possible for easily comparing and contrasting the information in each, should you choose (and I strongly encourage it üòÑ).

I hope they help you make better decisions about which one is the right tool for holding a particular bit of your data. üôè I've definitely learned a lot from trying to write them!
