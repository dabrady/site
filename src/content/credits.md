## design

The layout design for my written content is heavily based on the one created by Matthew Butterick for his book, [_Practical Typography_.](https://practicaltypography.com) I plan to iterate heavily, and already have, but I wanted to start from something I thought was beautiful already. Besides, redeveloping it was an awesome learning experience.

## font
The fonts for this site were purchased from Matthew Butterick and are being used in accordance with his license to the best of my ability. Don't steal them: if you like them, [buy them.](https://mbtype.com)
